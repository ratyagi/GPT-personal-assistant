## CSV  Format Requirements

Ensure your uploaded CSV file contains the following columns:

| Column Name | Description                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Date        | Date of transaction (e.g. 2025-01-05)   |
| Amount      | Expense amount (numeric)                |
| Category    | Expense category (e.g. Rent, Food)      |
| Description | Optional description of the transaction |

Example:

```
Date,Amount,Category,Description
2025-01-03,1240.00,Rent,January rent payment
2025-01-05,89.90,Utilities,Electricity and water bill
```

## Authentication System
![App Screenshot](./login_auth.png)

* Login and registration UI powered by `streamlit-login-auth-ui`
* Passwords hashed using Argon2 algorithm
* Cookie-based session persistence
* Password reset and email delivery functionality removed for simplicity

To register a new user, use the built-in sign-up form. User data is stored in `_secret_auth_.json` and managed via `utils.py`.

## API Endpoint

**POST** `/analyze`

* Accepts: Multipart-form CSV file + goal string
* Returns: JSON with summarized financial stats, GPT insights, and goal-related advice

Sample payload:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/analyze \
  -F "file=@expenses.csv" \
  -F "goal=Save $5000 for vacation"
```

## Future Improvements

* Integration with financial APIs (e.g., Plaid, YNAB)
* User dashboard with historical trends and comparisons
* Scheduled email reports and alerts
* Budget planning with predictive analytics
* Cloud-based deployment (Streamlit Cloud, Render, or AWS EC2)
